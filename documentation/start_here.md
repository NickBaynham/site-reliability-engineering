# Site Reliability Engineering

## Introduction

This repository will be my training and drill basis that is agnostic and entirely separate from my company related projects. This allows me to work on learning objectives and projects without that activity getting mixed up with actual productivity and all activites will be publically visible (transparent) and exist in the cloud outside of work tasks and using personal resources and accounts.
